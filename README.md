# hardhat gitpod

This project is a boilerplate for building HardHat solutions on Gitpod. It starts from the most basic setup possible:

1. A default package.json with nothing installed
2. A .gitpod.yml that runs npm install
3. This README.md file
4. A DEVLOG.md file that documents the development process
